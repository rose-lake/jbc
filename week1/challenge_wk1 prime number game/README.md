# Week 1 Challenge

## Description

### Part 1:

The user will have to input a number, and you will display that number. 

You will check if that number is prime and indicate that to the user. 

For example, if the user typed 10, it would display the following output: 

```
10 is not a prime number 
```

### Part 2:

After part 1, in the next part generate a random number between 1 and 250 (you can make this range larger if you'd like).  

As with part 1, you will print the number and print whether it is a prime number. 

### wrapper 1:

Modify your program to give the user a choice to pick between part 1 and part 2 at the start of the program.

For example, the program should ask the user:
```
"Would you like to generate a random number or input a number? (R/I)"

// if the user types "R", proceed with random number

"Generating a random number..."

// otherwise, if the user types "I", proceed with taking an input

"Please enter a number: "
```

### wrapper 2:

Modify your program  now to give the user a choice to try again.
 
```
"Would you like to try again? (Y/N)"

// if the user types "Y", proceed with repeating the program
"Would you like to generate a random number or input a number? (R/I)"

// if the user types "R", proceed with random number

"Generating a random number..."

// otherwise, if the user types "I", proceed with taking an input

"Please enter a number: "
```
