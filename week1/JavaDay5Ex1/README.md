# substring() length() charAt()

More practice with using methods that are unique to the String class.

# Description

Create a program that will allow users to enter a word, and a character number index. 
Your program will print out the size of the word, as well as the substring (starting from 0) to the index the user specified. 
If the user entered index is larger than the size of the word, the program will print "Index is larger than length".

## Sample Input:
```
Enter a word: alphabet
Enter a number as an index: 3
```

## Sample Output:
```
The length of alphabet is: 8
The substring from 0 to 3 is: alp
```
