# Formatting Strings

Write a Java program to print the following columns of values. Use \t for the tabs between the columns.

```
Cost      Quantity   Total
$1,000.00   4       $4,000.00
$   50.00   8         $400.00
______________________________
TOTAL:      12      $4,400.00
```

So, my program outputs:
```
Cost		Quantity	Total
$1,000.00	4		$4,000.00
$   50.00	8		$  400.00
______________________________
TOTAL:		12		$4,400.00
```
Which is super close, and lacking more detailed project requirements, 
I'm not going to spend my time trying to figure out how to *exactly* replicate the output given! ;-) ;-p
