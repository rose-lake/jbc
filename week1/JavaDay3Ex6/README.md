# Loops! A set of 9(ish) exercises...

This code contains (commented and uncommented) sections which answer the following questions:

NOTE that #9 below has been implemented as a separate package and has its own repository (see JavaDay3Ex7).
NOTE that #11 will also be implemented separately.

## Commented out:
The current version of the code has the implementations of 1 - 8 commented out

## What will run:
When you run the code, the implementation of 10 will run. 
- Note: #10 It has interesting limitations which I haven't fully explored it.
 
## REQUIREMENTS: 

1. Write a program that prints the numbers 1-10.
2. Write a program that prints the numbers 1-10 backwards.
3. Write a program that prints all the odd numbers from 1-20.
4. Write a program that prints all the even numbers from 1-20.
5. Have the user input a number and print all numbers from that input value to 1.
6. Sum all values from 1-10.
7. Have the user enter a number and print the sum of all numbers from that inputted value to 1.
8. Write loops to print the following:
```
i)

**********
**********
**********
**********

ii)

*
**
***
****
*****

iii)

    *
   **
  ***
 ****
*****
```
9. Guessing Game: see separate repository (JavaDay3Ex7)

10. Factorial of a Number: 

You are going to write an application to determine the factorial of a single number.

A factorial of an integer is the product of that integer and all the integers below it. For example, the factorial of 4 is (4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24).

The user will be required to enter an integer.

You will then calculate the factorial of that integer and print the result to the screen.
