# Simple Eliza

You will be creating an interactive chat-bot type program. 
Eliza is a therapist program that interacts with the user. 
Your program will need to evaluate what the user asks and turn the user's input into a question that sounds like the therapist really cares.

## This Assignment
- Your first task is to develop a program with a running loop. 
- If the user types in "I am feeling great" or enter "Q", the program will stop running. 
- Your program should print out the last input (as an output) every time before accepting new input. 
- Make sure you are accommodating for NO case-sensitivity. (Q is the same as q)

Example output:
```
Good day. What is your problem? Enter your response here or Q to quit: my teacher hates me
my teacher hates me
Enter your response here or Q to quit: i dont know what's wrong
i dont know what's wrong
Enter your response here or Q to quit: i am feeling great
i am feeling great
>>> END
```
