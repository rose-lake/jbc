# Loops, times two!

The following exercises are implemented, in reverse order, in this class:

1. Prompt user for input, display the cube of all numbers up to that bound.
2. Prompt user for input, display the multiplication table for that number up to 10.
```
Eg. 15:
1 x 15 = 15
2 x 15 = 30
.
.
.
10 x 15 = 150
```
3. Prompt user for input, output all odd numbers up to that bound and then the sum of those odd numbers.
4. Prompt user for input, output all even numbers up to that bound and then the sum of those even numbers.
5. [this exercise not provided]
6. Write a loop to display the following:
```
1
12
123
1234
12345
```
7. Write a loop to display the following:
```
1
22
333
4444
55555
```
8. Write a program to display the following:
```
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
```
9. Write a program to display the following:
```
1 
01
101 
0101 
10101
```
10. Prompt user for input, determine if that number is a palindrome (a number that reads the same forward and backwards) e.g. 121 is a palindrome.
11. Write a program to sum all the integers between 100 and 200 that is divisible by 9.
