# Basics

This contains my implementations of assignments and exercises for guiding students through Java fundamentals.

The concepts include variables, control structures, strings, arrays, and hashmaps, as well as some file i/o.

# MiniApps

This is a place for all the "mini apps" that I implemented as part of the java boot camp.

Exercises, basic weekly challenges, etc.

These run from the mundane to the slightly more complex.
